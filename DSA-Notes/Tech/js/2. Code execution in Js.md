1. the global execution context is formed and is stored in the (this) keyword
it will have the window object in brower and {} if its node

*  in the memory phase all the variables are created and are assigned undefined values
* function are craeted with definitions

* once the memory phase is completed the code enters execution stage where the values are assigned to the variables.
* once it reaches a function with definition it will invoke one more block that consists of (memory phase and execution phase) and once this block is executed the values are returned to global and the block is deleted

call stack
*  follows LIFO and each function is added to the stack and once execution is completed it is removed from it
