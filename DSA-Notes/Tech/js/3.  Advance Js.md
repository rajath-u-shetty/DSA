```javascript
document-getElementById('title').getAttribute('id')
'title'

document-getElementById( 'title').getAttribute( 'class')
'heading'

document-getElementById( 'title').setAttribute( 'class', 'test')
undefined

document-getElementById( 'title').setAttribute('class', 'test heading')

```

* storing it in a variable
```javascript
const title = document-getElementById('title').getAttribute('id')
```

diff b/w innerText, textContent
```javascript
title. innerText
'DOM learning on Chai aur code' //only displays the visible text on the webpage

title.textContent
'DOM leaining on Chai aur code test test'
//displas the hidden text also
```

## getElementByClassName

* it will return a html collection of elements with same class name
* we can access them using index
```javascript
it does not have any looping function to access individual elemenst and hence we convert it to array and then make changes

const AllListItems = documnet.getElementByClassName("list-item");
Array.from(AllListItems);
```

## query selector

* document.querySelector("h1") //returns the first h1 tag
```javascript
 document.querySelector("#heading") // for id
 document.querySelector(".heading") // for class
```

* document.queryselectorAll("h2") // returns all the h2 in a NodeList
```javascript
we have access to method like forEach here and not like map and filter.
we can convert it to array just like HTMLCollection using Array.from

const allH2 = document.querySelectorAll("h2")
```

## DOM example code

```javascript
    function addLanguage(langName){
        const li = document.createElement('li');
        li.innerHTML = `${langName}`
        document.querySelector('.language').appendChild(li)
    }
    addLanguage("python")
    addLanguage("typescript")

    function addOptiLanguage(langName){
        const li = document.createElement('li');
        li.appendChild(document.createTextNode(langName))
        document.querySelector('.language').appendChild(li)
    }
    addOptiLanguage('golang')
```
* second approach is optimal since we use createTextNode function for creating the text inside the document and aslo direrctly appends the element  bcz we do not have to travserse the tree to fetch tht element

```javascript

    //Edit
    const secondLang = document.querySelector("li:nth-child(2)")
    console.log(secondLang);
    //secondLang.innerHTML = "Mojo"
    const newli = document.createElement('li')
    newli.textContent = "Mojo"
    secondLang.replaceWith(newli)
    //replacing is optimal thann chaning the value

    //edit
    const firstLang = document.querySelector("li:first-child")
    firstLang.outerHTML = '<li>TypeScript</li>'

    //remove
    const lastLang = document.querySelector('li:last-child')
    lastLang.remove()

```



## Event Listeners

```javascript
1st approce
adding events directly on that tag
<button onClick={}></button>

2nd
document.getElementById('owl').onclick = function(){
     alert("owl clicked")
 }

//these two are not scalable in javascript.
// first approch is sclabed in react

// optimal
document.getElementById('owl').addEventListener('click', function(e){
     console.log("owl clicked");
     e.stopPropagation()
 }, false)
// the e(event) object that passed here in the function has so many properties that can be used.
eg (imp) -> 1. has a timestamp that tells when the event was executed.
	  2. has length and width
	  3. type -> keyboars,mouse events etc
	  4. defultPrevented
	  5. target
	  6. toElement
	  7. srcElement
	  8. clientX, clientY, screenX, screenY
	  9. altkey, ctrlkey, shiftkey, keyCode

```

* the addEventListener takes one more param that defies if the event should be event capturing or event bubling
* in event bubbling it goes from bottom to top. first the data on li is printed and then the one from ul tag
* event capturing is opposite and its from top to bottom. the defauly is false here. i.e event bubbling
* e.stopPropagation() will stop bubling and only the inner one is executed.
* e.preventDefault() stops the default behavoiur of a function. eg redirecting
```jsx
 document.getElementById('images').addEventListener('click', function(e){
    console.log("clicked inside the ul");
 }, false)

 document.getElementById('owl').addEventListener('click', function(e){
	 cosole.log("li tag")
     console.log("owl clicked");
     e.stopPropagation()
 }, false)
```

## Async code

sync -> blocking code / block the flow of propagation
async -> non-blocking code / does not break the flow of code

* javascript engine is not async
* but he environment of javascript is async
* it allows for execution of async code
![[Screenshot 2025-03-30 at 5.59.57 PM.png]]

## setTimeout & clearTimeout
* setTimeout function executes a piece of code after a certian period of time
* if this code inside the not executed properly or we wanna stop it manually. then we can use the clearTimeout Function to do this.
* clearTImeout will take a reference of the setTimeout function that it should stop. so store it as a variable and pass it as a param to clearTimeout func.
```javascript
 const changeText = function(){
        document.querySelector('h1').innerHTML = "best JS series"
    }

    const changeMe = setTimeout(changeText, 2000)

    document.querySelector('#stop').addEventListener('click', function(){
        clearTimeout(changeMe)
        console.log("STOPPED")
    })
```

## setInterval & clearInterval

* executes contineously after a certain period of time


## Promises

* promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an async operation.
* promises are executes in 2 stages
* 1 -> creation of a promise, 2-> consumption of the promise

* the promise takes a callback function which has 2 parama -> resolve & reject
* inside the callback function we can perform the async calls, DB calls etc. and if the code is executed correctly then in the end we can call the resolev() function. it will connect the promise to .then() method of the promise and the code inside .then() is executed
* we can also send data from resolve() func to .then() by passing the data inside resolve()
```js
const promiseThree = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    setTimeout(function(){
        resolve({username: "Chai", email: "chai@example.com"})
    }, 1000)
})

promiseThree.then(function(user){
    console.log(user);
})
```

* if the code in the promise os not executed properly or if it fails then we call the reject() function and the code inside .catch() method is executed.
* we can also chain a series of .then() methods together to pass info from one to other.
*  the code inside .finally() is executed irrespective of the promise being resolved or rejected
```js
const promiseFour = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    setTimeout(function(){
        let error = true
        if (!error) {
            resolve({username: "hitesh", password: "123"})
        } else {
            reject('ERROR: Something went wrong')
        }
    }, 1000)
})

 promiseFour
	 .then((user) => {
	    console.log(user);
	    return user.username
	}).then((username) => {
	    console.log(username);
	}).catch(function(error){
	    console.log(error);
	}).finally(() => console.log("The promise is either resolved or rejected"))
```


## OOPS

* constructor in js
* if we do not use the new keyword while creating a new instance of the obj then it will over-write the same data in the this
* using the new keyword will create a new instance of the obj everytime.
* the new keyword calls the constructor funtion and sends the params required 
```js
function User(username, loginCount, isLoggedIn){
    this.username = username;
    this.loginCount = loginCount;
    this.isLoggedIn = isLoggedIn

    this.greeting = function(){
        console.log(`Welcome ${this.username}`);

    }

    return this
}

const userOne = new User("hitesh", 12, true)
const userTwo = new User("ChaiAurCode", 11, false)
console.log(userOne.constructor);
//console.log(userTwo);
```


# Prototype in js


### heirarchy

	null
	|
	object
	|
function | array | string
* js follows a prototype behaviour. if it cannot a value then it searches it at the parent level, then grand parent and then so on to confirm the value is null.
* so array, function and string has access to all the methods and properties of an object.


## new keyword
* 
* an array craerted in js hs acces to properties like length, and prototype methods like tolowercase, uppercase etc.

* we can assign new custom methods inside a function using the prototype present inside the object. 
* once a custom method is declared we should use the this keyword to tell that that value of that function should be increased which has called the funtcion. because here chai and tea both have access to the new method and we cant increment both the values.
* this specifies to increase the value who has specifically called it to increase the value.
* it provides context to make changes or execute the change

* all this is done but if we dont use the new keyword then the newly craeted methods are not injected into the variable this is specifically done using the new keyword.
* the chai variable has access to the printMe and increment functions while tea doesn't since they are not injected
* it also calls the constructor function and assign values
```js
function createUser(username, score){
    this.username = username
    this.score = score
}

createUser.prototype.increment = function(){
    this.score++
}
createUser.prototype.printMe = function(){
    console.log(`price is ${this.score}`);
}

const chai = new createUser("chai", 25)
const tea = createUser("tea", 250)

chai.printMe()


/*

Here's what happens behind the scenes when the new keyword is used:

A new object is created: The new keyword initiates the creation of a new JavaScript object.

A prototype is linked: The newly created object gets linked to the prototype property of the constructor function. This means that it has access to properties and methods defined on the constructor's prototype.

The constructor is called: The constructor function is called with the specified arguments and this is bound to the newly created object. If no explicit return value is specified from the constructor, JavaScript assumes this, the newly created object, to be the intended return value.

The new object is returned: After the constructor function has been called, if it doesn't return a non-primitive value (object, array, function, etc.), the newly created object is returned.

*/
```

## prototype

* we can inject a new method into the prototype of the Object (its called factory call) and then each object created globally will have access to the newly craeted method
* we can do the same with array 
* array will have the access to the newly created method in the Object class as it is below the heiracrcy of object and object acts as a parent class.(inheritence of the method)
* while a new method created for the Array class will not be accesible from the Object class.
```js
let myHeros = ["thor", "spiderman"]


let heroPower = {
    thor: "hammer",
    spiderman: "sling",

    getSpiderPower: function(){
        console.log(`Spidy power is ${this.spiderman}`);
    }
}

Object.prototype.hitesh = function(){
    console.log(`hitesh is present in all objects`);
}

Array.prototype.heyHitesh = function(){
    console.log(`Hitesh says hello`);
}
```

* lets says we have 2 constructors and we have to assign the properties of one to the other
```js
const Teacher = {
    makeVideo: true
}

const TeachingSupport = {
    isAvailable: false
}

const TASupport = {
    makeAssignment: 'JS assignment',
    fullTime: true,
    __proto__: TeachingSupport
}

Teacher.__proto__ = User

// modern syntax
Object.setPrototypeOf(TeachingSupport, Teacher)

```

## Call

* passes the current execution context(this) from one constructor/function to another
* here we are using another constructor insde createUsesr to assign the username.
* so while injecting values it''ll not be saved. hence we use  the .call() method and pass out context(this) to the constructor.
```js
function SetUsername(username){
    //complex DB calls
    this.username = username
    console.log("called");
}

function createUser(username, email, password){
    SetUsername.call(this, username)
   
    this.email = email
    this.password = password
}

const chai = new createUser("chai", "chai@fb.com", "123")
console.log(chai);
```


## Getter and Setters.
(private properties)
* we can use the get keyword for a property and then get its value
* if a getter is defined tehn we have to define its setter.
* the setter will overwrite the value from the constructor and cuases error hence we take _property. to avoid this. but it eill overewrite that property only.
```js
class User {
    constructor(email, password){
        this.email = email;
        this.password = password
    }

    get email(){
        return this._email.toUpperCase()
    }
    set email(value){
        this._email = value
    }

    get password(){
        return `${this._password}hitesh`
    }

    set password(value){
        this._password = value
    }
}

const hitesh = new User("h@hitesh.ai", "abc")
console.log(hitesh.email);
```
